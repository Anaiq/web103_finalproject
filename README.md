## About

### Description and Purpose
The ‚ÄúLogic Puzzle‚Äù web application is an interactive browser-based game designed to challenge players‚Äô problem-solving skills. It features a clean, user-friendly interface, accessible puzzles, helpful hints, and answer validation. The project showcases our skills in front-end web development with an accessible and responsive design for all devices and backend functionality to store user progress and puzzle settings.

App Evaluation
1. Web: How uniquely web is the product experience?
It's designed for quick, focused gameplay, perfect while you are waiting for an appt, in line, airport, etc. Feels more natural on touchscreens. Responsive animations when complete a level to make it more engaging.

2. Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
You can test your logical thinking while having fun doing it.

3. Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
Massive brainteaser gaming market and large niche for logic puzzle games e.g. Brainzilla, Math is Fun, Puzzle Dell Puzzles.

4. Habit
Usage most likely daily or few times a week, possible d/t chasing better scores and more difficult challenges.

5. Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
V1 Would provide a simple easy game with basic scale progression, keep track of score/level, screen for winning and losing. V2 Adds on hard mode (more complex puzzles), possible sounds/animation when complete a stage or level. V3 Adds on a timers(9 secs) for each move, possible additional puzzle themes.

### Inspiration

We‚Äôre a team that loves making people think and have fun while they do it. One of us is all about designing cool game worlds and mechanics, and the other can‚Äôt resist a good logic puzzle. Together, we want to create games that spark curiosity, challenge the brain, and give players that ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment that keeps them coming back for more.

### Baseline Features
‚úÖ Baseline Features (MUST complete ALL)
Complete all of the baseline features. These features use the core skills developed in this course, including designing a database schema, creating a server, and connecting a frontend to the server.

- [] The web app includes an Express backend app and a React frontend app.
- [] The web app includes dynamic routes for both frontend and backend apps.
- [] The web app is deployed on Render with all pages and features working.

Backend Features

- [] The web app implements at least one of each of the following database relationship in Postgres:
    - [] one-to-many
  - [] many-to-many with a join table
- [] The web app implements a well-designed RESTful API that:
    - [] supports all four main request types for a single entity (ex. tasks in a to-do list app): GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE
        - [] the user can view items, such as tasks
        - [] the user can create a new item, such as a task
        - [] the user can update an existing item by changing some or all of its values, such as changing the title of task
        - [] the user can delete an existing item, such as a task
    - [] Implements proper naming conventions for routes.
The web app includes the ability to reset the database to its default state.

Frontend Features

- [] The web app implements at least one redirection, where users are able to navigate to a new page with a new URL within the app
- [] The web app implements at least one interaction that the user can initiate and complete on the same page without navigating to a new page.
- [] The web app uses dynamic frontend routes created with React Router.
  - [] The web app uses hierarchically designed React components:
    - [] Components are broken down into categories, including page and component types.
    - [] Corresponding container components and presenter components as appropriate.
- [] The project is deployed on Render with all pages and features that are visible to the user are working as intended.


### Custom Features
Choose at least two custom features to include in your app. These features will make your app stand out with a more custom look and functionality.

- [] The web app gracefully handles errors.
- [] The web app includes a one-to-one database relationship.
- [] The web app includes a slide-out pane or modal as appropriate for your use case that pops up and covers the page content without navigating away from the current page.
- [] The web app includes a unique field within the join table.
- [] The web app includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions.
- [] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case.
- [] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account.
- [] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
